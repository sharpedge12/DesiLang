# DesiLang

**DesiLang** is a simple, easy-to-learn programming language designed with Hinglish syntax (a blend of Hindi and English) to make programming more accessible to people who are comfortable with both languages. Whether you're new to programming or looking to enhance your coding skills, **DesiLang** aims to simplify the learning process for non-English speakers.
